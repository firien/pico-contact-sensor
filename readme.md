## Facts & Interests

* I have a bunch of contact sensors around the house
* I have a couple of [EdgeRouter X SFP](https://store.ui.com/us/en/pro/category/all-wired/products/er-x-sfp)
* I would like to play around with microcontrollers
* I would like to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)

## Fantasy Project

Use the 24V that is blasted out of EdgeRouter X SFP to power [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/). Integrate an ethernet 100BASE-T connection. And do it all with Rust. ðŸ¤·

## Random mac os

cargo install elf2uf2-rs --locked   
rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi
